## 01-chinook-erd

### Introduction
Before we move on to shiny, new things we are going to ramp up the difficulty a bit, and introduce you to the [Chinook Database](https://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/), a sample db that countless back end devs have used for practicing their SQL skills. As the site tells us, "The Chinook data model represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers."

### Instructions
1. Hit the link above to download and unzip the file.
1. Open up DB Broswer for SQLite again, click 'open database', and select from the Chinook Database labeled `Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite`.
1. Be a good, honest, upstanding citizen and don't click the link on the Chinook home page to view the data model or search Google images for "Chinook database". Do your best to glean the relationships from the tables and make a complete ERD before peeking to see if you've hit the mark.

## 02-sql_queries-chinook

### Requirements
Use the [Chinook Database](https://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/) and the [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) we downloaded in the ERD exercise.

For each of the following exercises, provide the appropriate query.

Keep your successful queries in a `chinook-queries.sql` file.
